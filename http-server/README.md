# HTTP Server

This folder contains multiple exercises that will led us to build a HTTP API
from scratch, refactor it, port it to a library, add features as logging, 
authentication, etc.

The folders will be ordered by number and will match the order in which the
exercises will be made.

As of today:

1. HTTP Vanilla single file
2. Split into multiple files
3. Accept JSON
4. Add tests
5. Middleware for logging
6. Porting to a third party library
